This is a simple nodejs program I created in order to learn more about
JavaScript and practice test driven development.

It runs in command line and accepts three parameter a name, a bill amount and a
tip rate. It returns a javascript object including the tip amount and the total
amount owed including the tip.

To use it the file app.js needs to be run using nodejs in the terminal as below:

    node app.js MyName 12.56 10

In this example 12.56 represents the amount owed by the person named and 10
represents the tip rate i.e. 10%.
